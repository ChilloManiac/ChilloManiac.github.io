						<h1>About Me</h1>
						<p>My first experience with programming wasn't until I joined Aarhus University back in 2012. I enrolled in CompSci (Datalogi), and I thoroughly enjoyed programming. However during my two years there I became increasingly dissatisfied with the priorities on the education, in my opinion inciting students to pursue a PhD instead of preparing them to work as a software engineer.</p>
						<p> I suspected I might have chosen the wrong education and opted to switch to a related education called "IT". IT was teaching their students a broad set of skills, in an attempt to let them create embedded systems or in larger companies be the binding agent between developers, designers and engineers. Amongst them were programming, designing, electronic engineering, as well as a lot of emphasis on processes you have to go through from idea to product, such as user tests, user experience etc.</p>
						<p>While this education was closer to what I was looking for, unfortunately design was a much bigger part than I expected, and since I had a decent amount of credit for the software courses, I ended up spending more time designing teapots than I could muster.</p>
						<p>After a year and a half, and much thinking, I decided to take a break from university and focus on another more daring dream of mine. I gave myself a year to attempt to go professional in video games, DotA2 to be exact. This year has been the busiest time of my life, and I've learnt lots about myself and truly be standing on my own feet. It was an amazing experience and one that I'm glad I could have, but now that the year has concluded, and even though I'm dissapointed I never made it big, I'm fine with how it ended, the things I achieved and the friendships I made.</p>
						<p>I worked for Cetrea while studying IT, unfortunately leaving university meant I had to leave them as well. But from my experience there I do believe that I'm a strong enough programmer to start pursuing a full time job as a software developer, and as an aspiring developer there's plenty of Open Source projects to work with, as a way of gaining experience while the job hunt is ongoing.</p>
