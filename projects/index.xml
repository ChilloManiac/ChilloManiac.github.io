      <description>Aarhus Økologiske Fødevare Fællesskab AOFF is a volunteer group where members can buy cheap organic and local greens, differentiating each week. Being mainly maintained by volunteers chipping in, and their only programmer leaving, both their front- and back-end suffered. Multiple Ad-hoc solutions had been made, as nobody knew how to add items to their on-line web-shop, newer products were kept separate in a text document and added manually by a person, opening up for multiple human errors along the way.</description>

The Jamii was a console on which to create a independent market between gardeners, each urban gardening community would have their own marketplace were members could auction away any vegetables they would not use themselves, while they still are fresh, in return they would earn points that they themselves would be able to buy fresh veggies that another gardener had put up for auction.</description>

      <description>Ambient Bird This project was completed during the Advanced Physical Computing course. This course had three distinct aspects, combined to create an overall goal. First of all we were tasked to create our own embedded software, without using anything but micro controllers as our CPU, meaning no Arduino/Raspberry and the like. In our case we used an ATMega8. Secondly the product would have to be ambient, able to pass as an object in the background, while still managing to complete it&amp;rsquo;s task Thirdly it had to give value to peoples lives, e.</description>
