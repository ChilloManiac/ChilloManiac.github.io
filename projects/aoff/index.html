<p>AOFF is a volunteer group where members can buy cheap organic and local greens, differentiating each week. Being mainly maintained by volunteers chipping in, and their only programmer leaving, both their front- and back-end suffered. Multiple Ad-hoc solutions had been made, as nobody knew how to add items to their on-line web-shop, newer products were kept separate in a text document and added manually by a person, opening up for multiple human errors along the way.
<img src="/img/aoff.jpg#floatright" alt="The finished webpage" /></p>

<p>This was a major concern for AOFF, they&rsquo;ve had occasions were a new volunteer would step down, being confused by the multiple hacky solution they would have to keep track of, and the responsibility of doing so without making mistakes.</p>

<p>This project was not focused on programming as much as figuring out how to create a new system, in which the current problems would never occur again. Identifying what lead to these ad-hoc methods being invented and figuring out a sustainable solution was the main goal.</p>

<h3 id="technologies">Technologies</h3>

<p>With this projects focus in mind, most methods used where related to user experience, user tests and analysis&rsquo; of the organization. The webpage was developed using the CMS &ldquo;Drupal&rdquo; however i didnt work closely with the implementation of the product</p>
