<h2> Norbjerg.dk </h2>
<h3> This very website </h3>
<p>A small site created mainly to be my online portfolio, as well as getting my hands on some languages i haven't worked with for a while.</p>
<p>It was also a good excuse to get my hands dirty with some new tools for making websites, most notably "css grids", as well as refreshing my memory on languages i haven't touched in a while, such as less (css pre-processor) and javascript.</p>
<h4>Technologies</h4>
<p>Html, less (css), javascript and node.js for gulp, browser-sync and automatic less compilaiton.</p>
