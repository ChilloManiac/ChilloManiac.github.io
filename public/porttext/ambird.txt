<h2> Ambird </h2>
<h3>Ambient Bird</h3>
<p>This project was completed during the Advanced Physical Computing course. This course had three distinct aspects, combined to create an overall goal. 
First of all we were tasked to create our own embedded software, without using anything but micro controllers as our CPU, meaning no Arduino/Raspberry and the like. In our case we used an ATMega8. 
Secondly the product would have to be ambient, able to pass as an object in the background, while still managing to complete it's task
Thirdly it had to <i>give value</i> to peoples lives, e.g. saving the environment, bringing people closer together etc.</p>
<p>Out of these requirements came the Ambird, an attempt to create a different tool to communicate in long-distance relationships. Each Ambird is paired with exactly one other Ambird, which is then given to the partner. By hovering your hand over the bird, and moving up and down, you could scroll through up to 8 preprogrammed colors and by whistling send that color to your paired device. The partner's Ambird would then light with that color until cleared by hovering your hand above the lamp.</p>
<p>The idea was for the couple to develop their own language of colors to use, to communicate their mood or thoughts to each other without having to put in in words. </p>
<h4>Technologies</h4>
<p>The microcontroller was programmed using Basic <a href="public/examples/ambird.txt">(code example)</a>.</p>
<p>The rest of the project was mainly consisting of piecing together small electronics such as sensors, LEDs and making circuit boards. Lastly, much effort also went into researching and proving that our solution <i> gave value.</i></p>
