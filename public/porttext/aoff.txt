<h2>AOFF </h2>
<h3>Aarhus Økologiske Fødevare Fællesskab</h3>
<p>AOFF is a volunteer group where members can buy cheap organic and local greens, differentiating each week. Being mainly maintained by volunteers chipping in, and their only programmer leaving, both their front- and back-end suffered. Multiple Ad-hoc solutions had been made, as nobody knew how to add items to their on-line web-shop, newer products were kept separate in a text document and added manually by a person, opening up for multiple human errors along the way.</p>
<p> This was a major concern for AOFF, they've had occasions were a new volunteer would step down, being confused by the multiple <i>hacky</i> solution they would have to keep track of, and the responsibility of doing so without making mistakes.</p>
<p> This project was not focused on programming as much as figuring out how to create a new system, in which the current problems would never occur again. Identifying what lead to these ad-hoc methods being invented and figuring out a sustainable solution was the main goal.</p>
<h4>Technologies</h4>
<p>With this projects focus in mind, most methods used where related to user experience, user tests and analysis' of the organization.</p>
